     * Purpose: The base class for traffic vehicles (NPCs)

     * PlayerVehicle as it has different propertiesâ€”it's an obstacle, not a controllable entity.
     *
     * Key Properties: damage (how much damage it does on collision)
     * and cash (how much money the player gets for hitting it).
     *
     * Design Principle:
     * Inheritance: Serves as the parent for specific traffic vehicles like Sedan and Van.
